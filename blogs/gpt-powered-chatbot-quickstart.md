    1 How to build an AI that can answer questions about your website
</span>
</a></h3>



This tutorial by openAI provides a simple yet effective approach to building an AI that can answer questions about your website. The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide that covers all the necessary components required to build the chatbot. The tutorial starts by walking through how to crawl a website, turns the crawled pages into embeddings using the OpenAI Embeddings API, and then creates a basic search functionality that allows a user to ask questions about the embedded information.



The tutorial assumes that the reader has some basic knowledge of Python and GitHub. Before diving in, the reader is advised to set up an OpenAI API key and walk through the quickstart tutorial to have an understanding of how to use the API to its full potential. The main programming language used in this tutorial is Python, along with popular packages such as Pandas, transformers, NumPy, and others.


The tutorial provides the full code on GitHub, which the reader can clone. Alternatively, the reader can follow along and copy each section into a Jupyter notebook and run the code step by step, or simply read along. The tutorial also provides useful functions to remove extra spacing and new lines, which can clutter the text and complicate the embeddings process.

The tutorial is well-organized and provides clear explanations of the code and each step involved in building the chatbot. The code snippets are also easy to follow, and the tutorial provides helpful tips to avoid any issues that may arise. The tutorial provides a helpful rule of thumb, which is that one token generally corresponds to ~4 characters of text for common English text. This is helpful in determining the number of input tokens required for embeddings.


Overall, this tutorial provides an excellent starting point for building more sophisticated chatbots that make use of custom knowledge bases. The tutorial is suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers, and the step-by-step guide makes it easy to follow along. If the reader runs into any issues working through this tutorial, they can ask a question on the OpenAI Community Forum.

The OpenAI Cookbook's "Question answering using embeddings-based search" chapter provides a detailed and practical explanation of a two-step Search-Ask method for enabling GPT to answer questions using a library of reference text. The chapter addresses the limitations of GPT's ability to answer questions on unfamiliar topics and suggests using a search-based approach rather than fine-tuning the model.

The chapter covers the search process comprehensively, including lexical-based, graph-based, and embedding-based search methods. It suggests starting with embedding-based search as it works well with questions that often don't lexically overlap with their answers.

Furthermore, the chapter outlines a step-by-step procedure for implementing the Search-Ask method, including preparing search data, collecting, chunking, embedding, and storing the data. It also provides a detailed explanation of the search process, which involves generating an embedding for the query, ranking the text sections by relevance, and asking the question to GPT.

Overall, the OpenAI Cookbook's chapter on "Question answering using embeddings-based search" is an excellent resource for those looking to build chatbots or question-answering systems. The chapter is well-written and easy to follow, providing practical guidance for implementing the Search-Ask method. Additionally, the accompanying Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of the Search-Ask method, making it easy to replicate the process.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, building an AI assistant chatbot that can answer questions about documents, websites, or any other topic can seem like a daunting task, but there are many resources available to help. The three resources discussed in this article provide comprehensive and detailed guides to building chatbots using different approaches, such as embeddings-based search and APIs. The tutorials are suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers and provide step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and helpful tips to guide the user through the process. With these resources, anyone can start building their own AI assistant chatbot and provide helpful assistance to users.
